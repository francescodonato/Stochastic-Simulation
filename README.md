# Stochastic-Simulation

This project is split in 3 part: in part 1 there is an implementation of a RNG (Random Number Generator) and the generation of different type of distributions (both Discrete and Continuous); in part 2 different simulation techniche are implemented (Discrete Event Simulation for a queue system, Simulated Annealing and Variance Reduction methods); part 3 is a simulation of a LÃ¨vy process implemented as Shiny app.
